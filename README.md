# Diabetes_Prediction_Model
a Machine Learning model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm to predict whether a person is diabetic according to medical parameters. The project involves
preprocessing the dataset with feature scaling, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training
the SVM classifier with a linear kernel, and evaluating the accuracy of the model. The model can also
make real-time predictions for new input data.
